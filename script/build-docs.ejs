# <%= package.name %>

<%= package.description %>

## Install

```
$ npm install <%= package.name %>
```

## Usage

<%= package.name %> is based on [superagent][] and all methods that make API calls will return a superagent Request instance configured for the request. This means that you can do anything with Flickr requests that you can do with superagent.

The Flickr API is divided into several services:

- The [REST API][services/api] service, which provides access to Flickr data
- The [OAuth][services/oauth] service, which authenticates users via OAuth 1.0
- The [Feeds][services/feeds] service, which provides feeds of public Flickr data
- The [Upload][services/upload] service, where you can upload photos!
- The [Replace][services/replace] service, where you can replace photos you previously uploaded

**Example**

``` js
const Flickr = require('<%= package.name %>');

const flickr = new Flickr(process.env.FLICKR_API_KEY);

const { body } = await flickr.photos.getInfo({
  photo_id: 'your photo id here',
})
```

### Browser Usage

Since OAuth 1.0 requires your application's key and secret to sign requests, <%= package.name %> does not support this authentication method in the browser. Upload, Replace, and REST API calls that require authentication will not work without a valid OAuth signature. You can still use <%= package.name %> to call REST API methods that don't require authentication or to get public feeds.

<%= package.name %> has been tested with [browserify][] but should work with other client-side module bundlers like [webpack][] and [rollup][]. If you need a standalone browser-ready version of <%= package.name %>, each release on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/<%= package.name %>) will contain a browserified version of this module at `node_modules/flickr-sdk/flickr-sdk.js`. It is not minified.
